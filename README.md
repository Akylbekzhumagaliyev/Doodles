  Project Objective
  ------
    Inspired by Googles doodling game [Quick, Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/#), our group wanted to explore the world of convolutional neural networks(CNN) and how they work. To do this our goal was to see if we could produce a quick loading CNN on a web interface with no back end support. Users would choose a category and submit their own images to the CNN for decifering.      All while being as user friendly as possible.  (and fun too!)
